    "Welcome to my comprehensive notebook for the Kaggle Playground Series:Binary Classification of Insurance Cross Selling. This notebook demonstrates my end-to-end workflow, from data exploration and preprocessing to feature engineering and model tuning. The goal is to build a robust model that accurately predicts insurance responses. This particular version of this notebook is meant to be ran locally to be displayed on Github. "

    "## Preliminary Tests and Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the culmination of the creation of at least 50 different notebooks for this competition. As of the creation of this version I still haven't been able to obtain my ideal score, but I decided to share my favorite parts of my work. I started by testing the dataset on different models with only the necessary transformations done to the features. XGBoost and LightGBM stood out from the start. I settled on trying to perfect the LightGBM model by running it through hundreds of iterations across multiple weeks on OPTUNA. When I was satisfied with the validation scores, I submitted it to the competition and the results were lackluster. This led me to take a deep dive into other notebooks scoring high in the competition (all of which are referenced below). After trying all sorts of feature engineering techniques, through testing and research I found that the dataset worked best with the addition of a few interaction features. I later found a notebook along the highest scoring ones that created a blend out of other people's submissions. I found this interesting and decided to concuct my own blend. "

    "## Early Explorations\n",
    "\n",
    "I first started with a little exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic data processing. The data comes pretty clean, but the dataset is MASSIVE. The largest I had worked with previously had been around 70k rows, but this one had 11 million. Not many columns though. Most columns were fairly easy to handle except for `Region_Code` and `Policy_Sales_Channel`. I treated those by binning them into a rare category due to the heavy imbalance towards some values. Otherwise, everything was treated pretty basically.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made some basic EDA graphs to explore the data, using some base models to understand feature importances. Later, I discovered the magic of KLIB from another notebook: [Optuna XGBoost KLIB Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/suvroo/ps4e7-optuna-xgboost-klib), which taught me a thing or two about cleaning the data easily with KLIB, and how to keep track of hyperparameter studies with Optuna and some of its also amazing graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, I applied the basic preprocessing steps necessary to run the dataset efficiently in the models I was using. Also incorporating some downcasting to the workflow so that the model would work more efficiently. I tried applying some additional transformations to the data like removing outliers, creating rare categories for feature values with low counts, and creating KMEANS cluster feature. I also tested borrowed feature interactions from other notebooks and created my own. After possibly hundreds of tests, I settled on a combination of my own outlier removal using IQR and a set of feature interactions from [this Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rohanrao/automl-grand-prix-1st-place-solution)."

    "## What We Did in This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcased a detailed and comprehensive end-to-end workflow for tackling the Kaggle Playground Series S4E07 competition. Hereâ€™s a recap of our journey:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- **Initial Explorations:** We kicked off with a subset of the data to get a quick grasp of its structure and nuances. This initial dive helped us spot potential issues and interesting patterns early on.\n",
    "- **KLIB Visualizations:** We utilized KLIB for streamlined visualizations and correlation analysis, making it easier to pinpoint key features and understand their relationships with the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Values:** We meticulously checked for missing values to ensure data integrity throughout the modeling process.\n",
    "- **Categorical Encoding:** By converting categorical variables into numerical formats, we prepped the data for machine learning models.\n",
    "- **Memory Optimization:** To efficiently handle the large dataset, we optimized memory usage through downcasting of data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering\n",
    "- **Creating New Features:** We got creative with feature engineering, developing new features by combining existing ones. This allowed us to capture interactions between variables that could boost model performance.\n",
    "- **Scaling Numerical Features:** Standard scaling was applied to numerical features to bring them onto a similar scale, which is essential for many machine learning algorithms to perform optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling and Evaluation\n",
    "- **Model Selection:** We chose three powerhouse models â€“ CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost â€“ each known for its unique strengths in handling structured data.\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation:** To get a reliable estimate of model performance, we used stratified k-fold cross-validation, ensuring our models were tested across diverse subsets of the data.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Leveraging Optuna, we efficiently tuned the hyperparameters, squeezing out the best performance from our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blending Predictions\n",
    "- **Ensemble Approach:** Instead of relying on a single model, we blended predictions from CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost based on their ROC-AUC scores. This ensemble method harnessed the strengths of each model, resulting in superior overall performance."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we performed exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training with blending at the end to form our best submission possible.. The final submission was blended using CatBoost, LightGBM and XGBoost with the best hyperparameters found by Optuna(or borrowed from other noteboks) and evaluated on the validation set. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected features and the tuned model. This notebook was designed to showcase a clean and optimized workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Large Datasets:** The 11 million rows were daunting. I downsampled the dataset for initial exploration to manage computational resources better.\n",
    "- **Imbalanced Dataset:** SMote was my go-to solution for balancing the target variable classes. SMote resulted in too much overfitting.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Given the computational constraints, I leaned heavily on Optuna for efficient hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameter tuning took almost two weeks without many gains."
