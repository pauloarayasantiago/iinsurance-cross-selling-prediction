    "# Preliminary Tests and Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a compilation of my favorite parts of many notebooks I created for this competition. It might not have been the best performing, but I picked this one because it had my favorite parts of all my attempts. Actually, it is one of at least 40 notebooks I created for this project. One of my biggest challenges was that I wasn't able to run the code efficiently in the cloud, so I had to use my own PC to fit and predict the models. Therefore, I settled for this 1% sample version as a showcase. The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate my workflow and interpretation of each part.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Early Explorations\n",
    "\n",
    "I first started with a little exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic data processing. The data comes pretty clean, but the dataset is MASSIVE. The largest I had worked with previously had been around 70k rows, but this one had 11 million. Not many columns though. Most columns were fairly easy to handle except for `Region_Code` and `Policy_Sales_Channel`. I treated those by binning them into a rare category due to the heavy imbalance towards some values. Otherwise, everything was treated pretty basically.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made some basic EDA graphs to explore the data, using some base models to understand feature importances. Later, I discovered the magic of KLIB from another notebook: [Optuna XGBoost KLIB Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/suvroo/ps4e7-optuna-xgboost-klib), which taught me a thing or two about cleaning the data easily with KLIB, and how to keep track of hyperparameter studies with Optuna and some of its also amazing graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "At first I applied the basic preprocessing steps neccessary to run the dataset efficiently in the models I was using. Also incorporating some downcasting to the workflow so that the model would work more efficiently. I tried applying some additional transformations to the data like removing outliers, creating rare categories for feature values with low counts and creating KMEANS cluster feature. I also tested borrowed feature interactions from other notebooks and created my own. After possibly hundreds of tests I settled on a combination of my own outlier removal using IQR and a set of feature interactions from [this Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rohanrao/automl-grand-prix-1st-place-solution).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameter Studies\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing hyperparameter studies on LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a PyTorch neural network, I realized, while cleaning up my files, that one of my base models had the best metrics so far. That is the one I built this model on. I later implemented Optuna with careful logging of the studies and ran hundreds of different iterations, mixing hyperparameters and different sample sizes to understand how the library worked.\n"

The final model was trained using LightGBM with the best hyperparameters found by Optuna and evaluated on the test set. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected features and the tuned model. This notebook was designed to showcase a clean and optimized workflow, but doesn't necessarily grant the best results for this competition.\n"

    "### Techniques for Balancing the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable was highly imbalanced, so I used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset. This technique generates synthetic samples for the minority class, but in this case in generated way too much overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### List and Description of Models Attempted\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried out several models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logistic Regression:** A solid baseline for binary classification.\n",
    "2. **Decision Trees:** Simple and good for capturing non-linear relationships.\n",
    "3. **Random Forests:** An ensemble method that improved decision tree performance.\n",
    "4. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost and LightGBM):** Advanced ensemble methods that handled the large dataset and boosted accuracy.\n",
    "5. **Neural Networks:** For capturing more complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "6. **Autoencoders:** These were great for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Large Datasets:** The 11 million rows were daunting. I downsampled the dataset for initial exploration to manage computational resources better.\n",
    "- **Imbalanced Dataset:** SMote was my go-to solution for balancing the target variable classes. SMote resulted in too much overfitting.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Given the computational constraints, I leaned heavily on Optuna for efficient hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameter tuning took almost two weeks without many gains."
